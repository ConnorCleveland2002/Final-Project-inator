# Final-Project-inator
The final project for Uconn Coding Boot Camp!  This half-year was allot of fun, and though it was fast paced, I've increased my coding knowledge exponentially.

Our project was tasked with creating a Full-Stack Web Application using MERN-stack.  Whilst I had difficulties, I managed to come up with a decent final product.  This project especially I'm thinking I will update in the future, and perhaps turn it into a marketable application for a customer to purchase.

In this application, users can create an account, login, and view lessons that are posted to the site, much like a blog.  In the future, users will have the ability to save any users or lessons they find interesting or useful, and possibly a in-site currency to purchase credits to be used to view hidden lessons for potential profit of the application.
